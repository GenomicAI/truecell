# Spatial analysis in truecell

Load the `truecell` skill first. A spatial object is an ordinary `Truecell` object
with one extra container: `obj.images`, holding an `FOV` (imaging-based) or a
`VisiumV2` (spot-based).

## Loading

```python
import truecell

obj = truecell.load_xenium(path, assay="Xenium", fov="fov", keep_controls=False)
obj = truecell.load_visium(path, assay="Spatial", image=True,
                         image_resolution="lowres", filter_by_tissue=True)
obj = truecell.load_cosmx(path, assay="Nanostring", fov="fov")
obj = truecell.load_merscope(path, assay="Vizgen", fov="fov", keep_controls=False)
```

`keep_controls=False` drops the negative-control / blank probes — keep them only
when auditing the run's background.

Each loader builds the object Seurat's reader builds from the same files: the same
cells under the same names, the same features, and one image named by `fov`,
Seurat's argument. So a CosMx cell is `<cell_ID>_<fov>`, the `cell_ID` 0
background rows and empty cells are gone, and `obj.images["fov"]` is R's
`obj[["fov"]]`. `fov_column="fov"` gives one image per field of view instead.
The imaging loaders read centroids only, not the polygons or transcripts Seurat
also loads. `load_visium` and `load_xenium` have been checked against R on real
slides; `load_cosmx` and `load_merscope` only on synthetic bundles in each layout.

Test data:

```python
from truecell.datasets import xenium_mouse_brain, visium_mouse_brain
obj = truecell.load_xenium(xenium_mouse_brain())     # returns a Path
obj = truecell.load_visium(visium_mouse_brain())
```

Everything downstream — normalize, PCA, cluster — is the standard workflow. The
spatial functions are what you add on top.

## The containers

| Class | Holds |
|---|---|
| `FOV` | One field of view: boundaries + molecules for a set of cells |
| `Centroids` | Cell centre points, with `radius`, `nsides`, `theta` |
| `Segmentation` | Cell boundary polygons |
| `Molecules` | Individual transcript coordinates |
| `VisiumV2` | Spot coordinates **plus** the H&E image and its `ScaleFactors` |
| `ScaleFactors` | The `scalefactors_json.json` values |

```python
obj.image_names()
coords = truecell.get_tissue_coordinates(obj, image=None)     # DataFrame: x, y, cell
img    = obj.images["slice1"]
truecell.generics.radius(img)
truecell.generics.get_image(img)                              # VisiumV2 only
```

Build them by hand when your coordinates come from somewhere else:

```python
fov = truecell.create_fov(coords_df, type_="centroids", radius=10.0, assay="Xenium")
cen = truecell.create_centroids(coords_df, nsides=0, radius=10.0)
seg = truecell.create_segmentation(polygon_df)
fovs = truecell.create_fovs(coords_df, fov="fov_column")      # one FOV per level
```

`coords` frames are `x`, `y` (plus `cell`), indexed or columned to match the
object's barcodes.

### The Visium radius, which is a real divergence

`scalefactors_json.json`'s `spot_diameter_fullres` is a **diameter**, and Seurat
stores it in a slot named `radius`. Reading it as a radius makes each spot
overlap its neighbour by 31 µm on a slide with a fixed 100 µm pitch — the
geometry settles it. **truecell's `radius()` returns half of Seurat's, on purpose**,
and a test pins that divergence so it cannot be "fixed" back.

Also: R's `Radius()` returns `NULL` on a `VisiumV2` (there is no
`Radius.VisiumV2` method, only `VisiumV1`). truecell's `VisiumV2.radius()` answers.
This is the one tutorial where Seurat is the one that is wrong.

## Spatial statistics

```python
# How far is each cell of type X from the nearest cell of type Y?
d = truecell.nearest_neighbor_distance(obj, group_by="cell_type", reference="Astrocyte")

# How many of each type sit in each cell's k-neighbourhood?
n = truecell.local_neighborhood(obj, group_by="cell_type", k=10)

# Is a type over- or under-represented between conditions?
c = truecell.composition_test(obj, group_by="cell_type", split_by="condition")
```

All three return DataFrames and leave the object alone.

## Niches

```python
truecell.build_niche_assay(obj, group_by="cell_type", k=20, niches=4,
                         assay_name="niche", cluster=True, seed=0)
fig = truecell.image_dim_plot(obj, group_by="niches")
```

Each cell is described by the composition of its `k` nearest neighbours; those
profiles are clustered into `niches` tissue neighbourhoods. `k` sets the spatial
scale — a small `k` finds tight micro-environments, a large one finds regions.
Sweep it rather than accepting the default; `niches` likewise.

## Spatially variable features

```python
svf = truecell.find_spatially_variable_features(
    obj, features=truecell.generics.variable_features(obj),
    method="moransi", weights="inverse_square",
)
top = svf.head(20)          # rank 1 is the most spatially structured
```

It reads `scale.data` by default, as Seurat does, so run `scale_data` over those
features first, or pass `layer="data"` to rank log-normalized values. Moran's I
is the same on both except where scaling clipped a value at 10.

**`weights="inverse_square"` is the default and reproduces R exactly** — 1/d²
between every pair of cells, row-standardised. It is O(n²). `weights="knn"` is an
approximation trading that for O(nk); reach for it only when the slide is too
large to wait on, and say which you used.

`method="markvariogram"` is the alternative. Its `r_metric=5.0` is **in units of
the median nearest-neighbour spacing** — the default means "five cells apart" —
and `bandwidth` is the half-width of the band around it. Widen `bandwidth` on a
sparse slide where the band catches too few pairs.

Pass `features=` (the variable features are a good default) — running on a full
panel is much slower and rarely tells you more.

Moran's I matches R to **1.6e-14**, and picks 10/10 of Seurat's top genes, on a
36,602-cell slide R cannot hold in memory.

## Plotting

```python
fig = truecell.image_dim_plot(obj, group_by="cell_type", size=1.0, flip_y=True)
fig = truecell.image_feature_plot(obj, feature="Slc17a7", cmap="viridis")

# Visium — spots drawn over the H&E at their true diameter
fig = truecell.spatial_dim_plot(obj, group_by="seurat_clusters", pt_size_factor=1.6)
fig = truecell.spatial_feature_plot(obj, feature="Hpca", image_alpha=1.0, crop=True)
```

`flip_y=True` is the default because image coordinates run top-down; flip it back
if your slide comes out mirrored against the source viewer.

Use `image_*` for imaging-based platforms (Xenium/CosMx/MERSCOPE) and
`spatial_*` for Visium, where there is a tissue image to draw under the spots.

## Handing off to Scanpy, Squidpy or SpatialData

```python
from truecell.compat.anndata import as_anndata, from_anndata

adata = as_anndata(obj)                     # obsm["spatial"], obs["fov"], uns["spatial"]
obj = from_anndata(adata, assay="Xenium")   # images rebuilt, a VisiumV2 included
```

`as_anndata` writes space in Scanpy's layout. `obsm["spatial"]` holds each cell's point,
from the first image that places it, and `obs["fov"]` names that image. A Visium image's
tissue photo and scale factors go to `uns["spatial"][image]`. On 10x's mouse-brain slide
the result is identical to `scanpy.read_visium`'s, so `sc.pl.spatial` works on it, and
`from_anndata` reads a `read_visium` file back into a `VisiumV2`. An image with only a
segmentation is written at `Segmentation.as_centroids()`, SeuratObject's centroid. Cell
polygons and molecules have no place in AnnData. For SpatialData, build shapes and a
table from the `as_anndata` result: the docs page *AnnData, Scanpy and SpatialData* has
the recipes, checked through zarr.

## Traps

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `from_anndata` gives an `RNA` assay on a Xenium file | Pass `assay=`; it is not read from `uns`. |
| `obj.images` empty after loading | Wrong path level — point at the directory holding the matrix and `spatial/`, not one above. |
| Plot is mirrored vertically | `flip_y`; toggle it. |
| `find_spatially_variable_features` never returns | `weights="inverse_square"` is O(n²) over all cells. Restrict `features=`, or use `weights="knn"` and note the approximation. |
| Spots overlap on the H&E | Radius vs diameter — see above. truecell is deliberately half of Seurat. |
| Control probes dominate the variable features | Loaded with `keep_controls=True`. |
| Niches look like cell types | `k` too small; the niche assay degenerates to the cell's own identity. |
