    ``max(shape) > 500`` it silently switches to a *randomized* solver, which
    is accurate in the leading components and drifts badly in the trailing
    ones. On a 2,400-cell ifnb subsample the randomized solver reproduced only
    15 of 30 PCs above |r| = 0.99 against Seurat — PC 28 came back at 0.006 —
    while ARPACK matched all 30 to six decimals, six times faster than a dense
    ``np.linalg.svd``. Every default ``n_pcs=30`` neighbour graph, clustering
    and UMAP sits downstream of those trailing PCs, and Seurat v5's
    ``IntegrateEmbeddings`` corrects the embedding itself, so the drift lands
    directly in its output.

    ARPACK needs ``k`` comfortably below ``min(shape)``, so small inputs (test
    fixtures, tiny assays) take the exact dense path instead — cheap at that
    size and immune to the convergence failures ARPACK hits when ``k``
    approaches the matrix rank.

    Notes
    -----
    Seurat runs `irlba` on ``XᵀGX``, which is an SVD and so ranks components by
    ``|λ|``; we take the largest eigenvalues themselves, since ``vᵀXᵀGXv`` is
    what is being maximised and a graph can push some eigenvalues negative. With
    non-negative edge weights the leading eigenvalues are positive and the two
    orderings agree, so this only ever differs in the tail.
