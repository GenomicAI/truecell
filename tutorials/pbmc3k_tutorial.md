# PBMC 3k Tutorial — R Seurat vs Truecell (Python)

A step-by-step translation of the official
[Seurat PBMC 3k tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial)
into Python using the **Truecell** package.
Every R code block is paired with the equivalent Python code and both plots are
shown side by side so R users can follow along directly.

> **Dataset:** 3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor — 10x Genomics (2016)  
> **R reference:** Seurat v5 · Hao et al. 2024  
> **Python:** Truecell

## Step 1 · Load Data

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr>

```r
# Read 10x sparse matrix from disk
pbmc.data <- Read10X(
  data.dir = "pbmc3k/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/"
)
# 32,738 genes × 2,700 cells

```python
# Downloads automatically to ~/.truecell_data/pbmc3k
# (or pass data_dir= to point at an existing folder)
counts, genes, cells = pbmc3k()
# counts : scipy.sparse.csc_matrix  (32,738 × 2,700)
# genes  : list[str]  – feature names
# cells  : list[str]  – barcode names
```

## Step 2 · Create Object

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>

## Step 4 · QC Scatter Plots

<table>

## Step 5 · Filter Cells

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>

```r
pbmc <- subset(
  pbmc,
  subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 &
           nFeature_RNA < 2500 &

# 2,638 cells retained
```

</td>
<td>

```python
md   = pbmc.meta_data
keep = (
    (md["nFeature_RNA"] > 200) &
    (md["nFeature_RNA"] < 2500) &
    (md["percent.mt"]   < 5)

pbmc = pbmc.subset(cells=list(md.index[keep]))
# 2,638 cells retained
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> `subset()` works in both languages. Python uses boolean pandas indexing;
> the result is identical (2,638 cells).

## Step 6 · Normalise Data

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>

```r
pbmc <- NormalizeData(

# Stored in pbmc.assays["RNA"].layers["data"]
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Both apply `log1p(counts / total_counts × 10,000)`.

## Step 7 · Highly Variable Features

<table>

</tr>
</table>

> Both plots use **Standardized Variance** on the y-axis, matching R's `VariableFeaturePlot`.
> Truecell reproduces Seurat's `vst` algorithm faithfully: it fits the mean–variance LOESS on
> the **raw counts**, then ranks genes by the variance of the standardized values after
> clipping each to `sqrt(n_cells)` (the clip step that stops single-cell outliers from
> dominating).
> R's `LabelPoints` (with `ggrepel`) avoids label overlaps; Truecell uses `matplotlib.annotate`
> which may overlap in dense regions.
> **Top-10 gene overlap: 9/10 (90%)** — the same `PPBP, LYZ, S100A9, IGLL5, GNLY, FTL, PF4,
> FTH1, S100A8` HVGs as the R tutorial; `GNG11` sits just outside the top 10 (rank 11).
> Minor rank differences come from the LOESS implementation (R: Fortran; Python: local
> quadratic fit).

## Step 8 · Scale Data

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>

## Step 9 · PCA

## Step 10 · Elbow Plot — Choose Dimensionality

## Step 11 · Find Neighbors & Cluster

> Both run Seurat's modularity optimiser: truecell's is a translation of Seurat's

> `resolution = 0.5` each returns **9** clusters, numbered alike, and the two runs
> agree about 2,562 of the 2,638 cells (**ARI 0.928**). Given the same graph they

### The whole sweep, not one point on it

Picking a resolution means running a few and comparing them, so a fidelity claim
pinned to a single setting says less than it looks like it does. The tutorial
runs `find_clusters(pbmc, resolution=[0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 0.5])` — Seurat's own
vector idiom — and scores every one against R:

| resolution | truecell | Seurat | ARI | concordance |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.4 | 9 | 9 | 0.9185 | 0.9701 |
| **0.5** | **9** | **9** | **0.9284** | **0.9712** |
| 0.8 | 11 | 11 | 0.9434 | 0.9746 |
| 1.2 | 11 | 12 | 0.9253 | 0.9632 |

The cluster count matches at 0.4, 0.5 and 0.8, and Seurat finds one more at 1.2.
Agreement stays between 0.92 and 0.94 across the sweep. It used to fall from
0.90 to 0.80 as the resolution rose, while the two tools ran different
optimisers.

0.5 is given **last** on purpose. Seurat leaves the object on the last
resolution in the sequence, so every step below — UMAP, markers, annotation, the
handoff — sees exactly the partition it saw before this sweep existed. The four
outputs this tutorial writes are byte-identical to what it produced without it.

Each ARI now carries a **declared band** (`CLUSTER_BANDS`), for a reason: this
file documented ARI **0.938** at resolution 0.5 while measuring 0.899, across six
documents. The number had drifted — most likely with the graph fixes in #67–#71,
which moved cells between clusters — and with no band on it, nothing failed.
That is the same drift the DE tutorial's `deseq2 top50` band *did* catch at the
time (25 → 22). The bands were re-measured when `find_clusters` became Seurat's
optimiser, which raised every ARI in the table above.
>
> Where it comes from is traceable: the two runs keep the **same 2,638
> barcodes** and agree on the per-gene VST means to 4.8e-14 and observed
> variances to 5.1e-14, but `variance.standardized` depends on a degree-2 LOESS
> fit that differs by up to 2.6e-2 relative — and `variance.expected`, the fit
> itself, differs by 2.5e-2, so the disagreement is the fit and only the fit. That flips **2 of the 2,000** variable features (both at
> ranks 1,982–2,000, and 0.03 apart in the fit), which moves the PCA slightly
> — matched \|r\| 0.9986 over the 10 dims clustering uses — which leaves the two
> SNN graphs 328 entries apart (194,226 against 194,554), which moves the cells
> the two partitions disagree about.

## Step 12 · UMAP

> **Note — UMAP layout difference is expected, not a bug.**
> R Seurat uses the [`uwot`](https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot) UMAP implementation
> while Python uses [`umap-learn`](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io). Both libraries
> apply the same UMAP algorithm but differ in initialisation strategy, nearest-neighbour
> graph construction, and optimisation details. As a result, the **spatial arrangement**
> of clusters will look different even with the same random seed — clusters may be
> rotated, reflected, or positioned further apart. This is a known and well-documented
> difference between the two libraries and does **not** indicate an error in the
> analysis. The important thing is that the **same 9 biologically meaningful clusters**
> are recovered in both, numbered alike: both tools number clusters by size.

|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `VlnPlot(pbmc, features, ncol, slot)` | `vln_plot(pbmc, features, ncol, layer)` | `slot` → `layer` |

### Plot output difference

```r
# R — plots render to graphics device automatically
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = "LYZ")
```

```python
# Python — functions return a Figure; display or save explicitly
fig = vln_plot(pbmc, features="LYZ")

# In a Jupyter notebook: just call the function — it displays inline
# To save:
fig.savefig("lyz_violin.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")
# To display interactively:
plt.show()
```

## Reproducing All Plots

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenomicAI/truecell.git
cd truecell
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e ".[analysis]"
python tutorials/generate_plots.py     # Truecell plots -> tutorials/figures/
Rscript tutorials/pbmc3k_verify.R      # R Seurat RidgePlot + the numeric handoff
```

Every other R panel in this tutorial links the canonical
[Seurat vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial) image;
only the RidgePlot (which the vignette omits) is generated locally by
`pbmc3k_verify.R`.

## Checking the numbers, not the pictures

Because the R panels are canonical images, every step above is compared by
eye. `pbmc3k_verify.R` also writes a numeric handoff — per-cell QC and PCA
keyed by barcode, per-gene VST statistics, the marker table, and a set of
scalar anchors — which `--report` compares:

```bash
python tutorials/pbmc3k_tutorial.py    # writes the Python side
Rscript tutorials/pbmc3k_verify.R      # writes the R side
python tutorials/pbmc3k_tutorial.py --report
```

Neither side is pinned to the other: both run their own pipeline from the same
10x bytes, which is what makes the comparison worth anything. What it reports
on this dataset:

| | truecell vs Seurat 5.5.1 |
|---|---|
| Cells surviving QC | **the same 2,638 barcodes**; nCount and nFeature exact, percent.mt to 5.3e-15 |
| VST per gene (13,714) | mean 4.8e-14 · variance 1.6e-11 · `variance.expected` 2.5e-2 · `variance.standardized` 2.6e-2, all relative |
| Variable features | **1,998 of 2,000 shared**, rank Spearman 0.9999 |
| PCA (10 dims) | matched \|r\| mean **0.9986**, min 0.9905, no reordering |
| kNN graph | **52,760 on both** (2,638 × 20) |
| Clusters | 9 vs 9 — **ARI 0.928**, concordance 0.971 (see Step 11) |
| Markers, where the clusters hold identical cells | **identical gene sets** (151/151, 927/927 and 242/242), `avg_log2FC` to 4.9e-15, 5.3e-15 and 4.6e-14 respectively |

That last row is the one to read carefully. Three clusters — B cells, dendritic
cells and platelets — came out with exactly the same membership on both sides,
and on those three the differential expression agrees gene for gene and to
machine precision. So the marker differences elsewhere are downstream of the
clustering, not of the DE code.

Two notes on reading the report's marker table:

- **`top10 by p` is not the right column to judge.** R's Wilcoxon p-values
  underflow to exactly 0 for the strongest markers — between 40 and 302 genes
  per cluster on this dataset — so Seurat's own top-10 ordering is decided by
  its fold-change tie-break, not by p. `top10 by FC`, which both tools resolve
  exactly, runs 8–10 of 10.
- Building this handoff found a real defect in `find_all_markers`: it was
  missing Seurat's `return.thresh = 0.01`, so it returned rows Seurat does not.
  It now applies the same filter and breaks p-value ties on descending
  `avg_log2FC` the way `FindAllMarkers` does.
