# A vial of blood, and nobody told you what's in it

### A guided tour of **truecell** — single-cell analysis in Python, ported from Seurat

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GenomicAI/truecell/blob/main/tutorials/truecell_guided_tour.ipynb)

Somebody drew blood, separated the white cells, and pushed 2,700 of them through a
droplet machine one at a time. What came back is a spreadsheet: **32,738 rows of genes,
2,700 columns of cells, and not one label anywhere.**

No cell in that file is marked "T cell". Nothing says which of them fight bacteria and
which remember a vaccine you had as a child. Every one of those answers is *in* the
numbers, and this notebook is the walk from the spreadsheet to the answer.

By the end you will have taken an unlabelled matrix and produced a map of human immune
cells with names on it — and, more usefully, you will know **why each step exists**, which
is the part that transfers to your own data.

**Along the way you'll meet the whole package**: the object model, quality control,
normalization, feature selection, PCA, graph clustering, UMAP, differential expression,
annotation, pseudobulk, gene-signature scoring, and a tour of everything else truecell
does that this one dataset can't show — integration, spatial, CITE-seq, CRISPR screens.

## 1 · The specimen

This is the PBMC 3k dataset from 10x Genomics — **peripheral blood mononuclear cells**
from one healthy donor. It is the fruit fly of single-cell genomics: small, public,
and analysed so many times that we know what the right answer looks like, which is
exactly what you want when you're learning the machinery.

The download is cached in `~/.truecell_data/`, so re-running this notebook won't
re-fetch it.

### That number deserves a second look

**Over 97% of this matrix is zero.** A beginner's instinct is that something went
wrong. It didn't — two true things stack up:

1. **Cells really don't express most genes.** A platelet has no use for the machinery of
   antibody production, so those genes are genuinely off.
2. **Sampling.** We capture only a small share of the mRNA in each cell, so a gene that
   *is* on but quiet often lands on zero purely by chance. This is the *dropout* problem,
   and it's why single-cell statistics look different from bulk RNA-seq statistics.

Because of that, the matrix is stored **sparse** — only the non-zero values are kept in
memory. truecell keeps it sparse for as long as it possibly can, which is what lets a
laptop handle datasets with hundreds of thousands of cells.

### Building the object

Everything from here lives in a `Truecell` object. If you've used Seurat in R, this is
the `Seurat` S4 class, ported: same slots, same vocabulary, Python naming.
""")

code(r"""
from truecell import create_truecell_object

pbmc = create_truecell_object(
    counts=counts,
    assay="RNA",

    feature_names=genes,
    cell_names=cells,
    min_cells=3,        # drop genes seen in fewer than 3 cells
    min_features=200,   # drop barcodes with fewer than 200 genes detected
)

pbmc
""")

md(r"""
Those two thresholds already threw away most of the file. **32,738 genes became 13,714**:
the rest were detected in fewer than three cells, so nothing downstream could have used
them anyway — you cannot compare a gene across groups if only two cells in the entire
experiment ever showed it.

The warning is one Seurat gives too. Its objects can't hold underscores in gene names, so
`CreateSeuratObject` turns them into dashes; truecell does the same, so every gene has one
name in both tools.

### What's inside the object

Four containers, and every step from here writes into one of them:

| Slot | Holds | Seurat equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.assays` | the expression matrices, in **layers** | `obj@assays` |
| `.meta_data` | one row per cell — QC stats, cluster IDs, anything you add | `obj@meta.data` |
| `.reductions` | PCA, UMAP, t-SNE embeddings | `obj@reductions` |
| `.graphs` | cell–cell neighbour graphs | `obj@graphs` |

The **layers** idea is worth pausing on. One assay holds several versions of the same
matrix at once — raw `counts`, log-normalized `data`, z-scored `scale.data` — so a
function can ask for the representation it needs and the raw numbers are never destroyed.
Right now only `counts` exists, because that's all we've done.

## 2 · Triage — which of these are even cells?

Here is the uncomfortable truth about droplet sequencing: **a barcode is not a cell.**
It's a droplet, and droplets go wrong in two directions.

- **Empty or nearly empty droplets** catch ambient RNA floating in the buffer instead of a
  cell. They show very few distinct genes.
- **Doublets** are two cells sharing one droplet. They look like a chimera — a T cell and
  a monocyte fused into a creature that exists nowhere in the body — and they show
  unusually *many* genes.

And a third failure isn't about droplets at all. When a cell is **dying**, its membrane
leaks. Cytoplasmic mRNA escapes, but the mitochondria — which carry their own genome —
stay behind. So the share of reads coming from mitochondrial genes climbs. A high
mitochondrial fraction is the classic signature of a cell that was already dying when we
caught it.

Human mitochondrial genes all start with `MT-`, so that fraction is one pattern match away.

Read them left to right:

- **`nFeature_RNA`** — the bulk sits around 800 genes per cell, with a thin tail climbing
  past 3,000. That tail is where doublets live.
- **`percent.mt`** — most cells are under 5% mitochondrial, and a few are far above it.
  Those are the dying ones.

That tight upward curve is what a healthy experiment looks like: cells with more molecules
have more distinct genes detected, flattening off as the common genes saturate. Points
falling *below* the curve — many molecules, few genes — are cells whose reads pile onto a
handful of transcripts, which is what ambient RNA contamination does.

### Drawing the line

Now the judgement call. We keep cells with **200–2,500 detected genes** and **under 5%
mitochondrial reads**.

Be clear about what those numbers are: **defaults from the original tutorial, not laws of
nature.** 5% mitochondrial is reasonable for blood; cardiac and muscle tissue are
legitimately mitochondria-rich and a 5% cutoff there would delete your best cells. The
right move on new data is always to plot first, as we just did, and cut where *your*
distribution says to.

## 3 · Making cells comparable

A problem we have to fix before comparing anything: **cells were not sequenced equally
deeply.** One cell yielded 2,000 molecules, its neighbour 8,000. If you compare raw counts
between them, the deeper cell looks like it expresses more of *everything*, which tells you
about the droplet, not the biology.

`normalize_data` fixes this the way Seurat does, in three moves per cell:

1. divide each gene's count by that cell's total (now it's a proportion),
2. multiply by 10,000 (a readable scale — "counts per 10k"),
3. take `log(x + 1)` — which compresses a handful of screaming-loud genes so they don't
   drown out everything else, while `+1` keeps the zeros at zero.

The result goes into a new layer. **The raw counts stay exactly where they were.**

md(r"""
Look at the relationship between the three columns. The same raw count maps to a *different*
normalized value depending on how deeply its cell was sequenced — which is precisely the
correction we wanted. `counts` and `data` now sit side by side in the same assay, and every
later function names the layer it wants.

## 4 · Which genes are worth listening to?

We have 13,714 genes. Most of them are **useless for telling cells apart** — not because
they don't matter biologically, but because every cell expresses them at roughly the same
level. Ribosomal proteins, core metabolism, the housekeeping machinery: essential to life,
uninformative about identity. If you're trying to tell a B cell from a monocyte, a gene
both express identically contributes nothing but noise.

What we want are genes that are **high in some cells and low in others**. But there's a
catch: in count data, highly expressed genes are *automatically* more variable — it's a
property of the Poisson-ish sampling, not of the biology. So the honest question isn't
"which genes vary most" but **"which genes vary more than a gene of their brightness
should"**.

That's what `vst` does: fit the mean–variance trend across all genes, then rank each gene by
how far it sits *above its own expected variance*.

Every dot is a gene: mean expression across, variability up. The black cloud is the
expected trend; the coloured points broke away from it.

**The top of that list is already telling you the answer.** `PPBP` and `PF4` are platelet
genes. `LYZ` and `S100A9` are myeloid. `GNLY` is a cytotoxic granule protein. Before any
clustering, the most variable genes in this blood sample are the ones that distinguish
immune lineages from each other — which is a good sign that the variation we selected is
the variation we came for.

From here, the pipeline works with these 2,000 genes instead of all 13,714. That's an
almost 7× reduction in width, with the discriminating signal kept.

## 5 · Compression, and what it compresses into

Two steps here, and the first is preparation for the second.

**Scaling** puts every gene on the same footing: subtract its mean, divide by its standard
deviation. Without it, PCA is dominated by whichever genes happen to be expressed loudest,
and "loud" is not the same as "informative". After scaling, a gene's *pattern* is all that
counts.

We scale all 13,714 genes rather than just the variable ones — slightly slower, but it means
any gene can be drawn on a heatmap later without going back a step.

### PCA: 2,000 dimensions down to a few dozen

Each cell is currently a point in 2,000-dimensional space. That's both too big to work with
and mostly redundant — genes travel in packs, and all the B-cell genes rise and fall
together, carrying one piece of information between them, not a hundred.

PCA finds those packs. Each **principal component** is a weighted combination of genes that
co-vary, ordered so PC1 captures the most variation, PC2 the next, and so on.

This is where single-cell PCA becomes genuinely interpretable, and it's worth looking at
rather than treating as a black box.

**Read PC1 as a sentence.** At one end: `CST3`, `LYZ`, `TYROBP`, `FCN1` — the myeloid

abstract axis. It is *myeloid versus lymphoid*, the deepest split in this sample,
discovered without being told that such a division exists.

PC2 does the same job one level down, separating B cells from T and NK cells.

### How many components are real?

explains, and the point where the curve flattens is where the signal runs out.

The curve drops steeply and levels off somewhere around PC 9–12. We'll take **10** and move
on.

Two honest notes about that choice. First, it's a soft decision — anything from 8 to 15
gives you substantially the same biology here. Second, err **high** rather than low: an
extra noisy PC is diluted by the ones carrying signal, whereas dropping a real one can
delete a rare cell type from your results entirely.

If you'd rather have a statistical test than an eyeball, truecell ports Seurat's
permutation approach too — `jack_straw()` and `score_jackstraw()` give each PC a p-value.
It costs minutes rather than seconds, which is why the elbow remains the working default.

## 6 · Finding the groups

Now the central act. Nobody told us how many cell types are in this vial, so we're not going
to tell the algorithm either. Instead:

1. **Connect each cell to its 20 nearest neighbours** in the 10-dimensional PCA space —
   a graph, where an edge means "these two cells look alike".
2. **Refine those edges** by shared neighbours (SNN): two cells that merely happen to be
   close get a weak link; two cells that also share most of *their* neighbours get a strong
   one. This is what makes the graph robust to the noise a raw distance would trip over.
3. **Find communities** in that graph — the Louvain algorithm, which searches for groups
   with many internal edges and few external ones.

Community detection doesn't need to be told how many groups to find. It discovers them.

Nine groups, from 703 cells down to 14. **Clusters are numbered by size**, largest first —
which is why the last two, cluster 7 with 32 cells and cluster 8 with 14, are the slivers.
Hold on to them; small clusters are routinely the interesting ones, and both turn out to be
genuine cell types rather than debris.

### `resolution` is a dial, not a truth

knob in the whole pipeline, and there is no correct setting — only settings appropriate to
the question. Watch what it does:

distinct marker genes.** That's the point where you've started splitting on noise.

We named those columns ourselves with `cluster_name=`. Left to itself, truecell names them
the way Seurat does — `RNA_snn_res.0.5` — including R's habit of printing `1.0` as `1`, so
`resolution=1.0` lands in `RNA_snn_res.1`. Ported scripts trip over that, which is why the
convention is reproduced rather than tidied up.

### Drawing it

The clusters were found in **10-dimensional space** — real, but unviewable. UMAP squashes
those 10 dimensions to 2 for display, trying to keep cells that were neighbours as
neighbours.

One warning, because it's the most common way single-cell figures get over-read: **in a UMAP,
distance between clusters is not meaningful.** Two blobs sitting far apart are not more
different than two sitting close. Within-cluster structure is trustworthy; between-cluster
geometry is an artefact of the layout. Use it to look, not to measure.

This is the slowest cell in the notebook, and most of that isn't the embedding — it's numba
compiling UMAP's inner loops the first time they're called. Subsequent runs are much faster.

## 7 · Naming the strangers

A cluster is a number. Biology needs a name, and the way to get one is to ask: **what does
this group express that the others don't?**

That's a differential expression test, run per gene: cells in cluster *X* against all the
rest. Start with one cluster, to see the shape of the output.

code(r"""
from truecell import find_markers

cluster0 = find_markers(pbmc, ident_1="0", only_pos=True, min_pct=0.25)
print(f"cluster 0 vs everything else — {len(cluster0)} genes pass the thresholds\n")
cluster0.head(8).round(4)
""")

md(r"""
Five columns, and each answers a different question:

| Column | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| `p_val` | raw Wilcoxon p-value |
| `avg_log2FC` | how many doublings higher in this cluster — **effect size** |
| `pct.1` | fraction of cells *in* the cluster expressing it |
| `pct.2` | fraction expressing it *elsewhere* |
| `p_val_adj` | Bonferroni-corrected across all genes tested |

### Read that table again, because it's a trap

`find_markers` returns results **sorted by p-value**, as Seurat's does, and look what floats
to the top: `RPS6`, `RPS12`, `RPL32` — ribosomal proteins. Their `pct.1` is 1.00 and their
`pct.2` is 0.99. They are expressed in *every cell in the dataset*, cluster or not.

They are not markers. They're an artefact of having thousands of cells: with samples that
large, a 3% difference is detected with overwhelming confidence, and the p-value collapses
to zero. **Statistical significance is nearly free here; it is not evidence of anything
interesting.**

What makes a marker useful is a large `avg_log2FC` *and* a wide gap between `pct.1` and
`pct.2` — present in nearly all of these cells, and in few of the others. So sort by effect
size:
""")

code(r"""
cluster0.sort_values("avg_log2FC", ascending=False).head(8).round(4)
""")

md(r"""
A completely different list — and now it means something. `CCR7`, `LEF1`, `TCF7` and `MAL`
are the naive-T-cell programme, and every one of them has a `pct.1` three to four times its
`pct.2`. Cluster 0 has declared itself.

Now all nine clusters at once — nine tests across thousands of genes, and still a second
or two, because the marker code filters genes before it densifies anything.

### Now do the reading

This is the step no algorithm does for you. You take those gene names to the literature —
or to a reference atlas — and match them to known cell types. For blood the canonical panel
is well established:

| Marker | Marks |
| --- | --- |
| `IL7R`, `CCR7` | CD4 T cells (`CCR7` high = naive, not yet activated) |
| `CD8A` | CD8 cytotoxic T cells |
| `MS4A1`, `CD79A` | B cells |
| `GNLY`, `NKG7` | NK cells |
| `LYZ`, `CD14`, `S100A9` | CD14+ monocytes |
| `FCGR3A`, `MS4A7` | FCGR3A+ (non-classical) monocytes |
| `FCER1A`, `CST3` | dendritic cells |
| `PPBP`, `PF4` | platelets |

A dot plot puts the whole panel against every cluster in one panel — **size** is the
fraction of cells expressing the gene, **colour** is the average level.

**That is the whole journey in one picture.** A 32,738 × 2,700 grid of unlabelled numbers,
turned into a map of the human immune system — every label derived from the data, none of
it supplied by us.

### Nine — and why to distrust the number anyway

The Seurat tutorial this mirrors ends with **nine** cell types, and so does this one, down to
the 32 dendritic cells and the 14 platelets. That agreement is recent. truecell 1.2.0 clustered
this same graph with a single pass of igraph's Louvain, which settles in a shallower optimum,
and there the dendritic cells sat inside the CD14+ monocytes: eight clusters. `find_clusters`
now runs Seurat's own modularity optimiser, restarts and random stream included, and on the
same graph it returns Seurat's partition.

So is nine the right answer? The data can tell you something more useful than a count:
whether a group holds together as you turn the dial. We computed five resolutions earlier, so
follow `FCER1A`, the dendritic-cell marker, through all of them:

""")

md(r"""
At 0.1 the dendritic cells are part of a 688-cell monocyte cluster, where `FCER1A` averages
under 1. From 0.3 to 1.5 they are the same 32 cells every time, with `FCER1A` near 15 against
at most 0.3 in any other cluster. **A group that holds together across the whole range of
sensible resolutions is a population; a group that appears at one setting is a parameter
choice.**

When a population only appears at high resolution, subclustering is usually the better way
to look for it: `.subset()` the lineage and re-run the pipeline on it alone. At high
resolution a rare population competes for attention with the whole dataset; in a subset it
has the field to itself.

Cluster counts move with parameters, with the random seed, and with package versions — this
one moved with a package version. What's stable is the marker evidence, and that's what you
should trust: the identity of a cluster is the genes it expresses, not its position in a
list.

### One more thing worth knowing about `rename_idents`

It maps **by name**, and it never complains. A cluster the dictionary doesn't mention keeps its
number; a key the clustering didn't produce is ignored. So a map written for one clustering and
applied to another doesn't fail — it names whatever now carries each number, and your figure is
confidently, invisibly wrong.

This is not hypothetical. Exactly that shipped in this project: a nine-entry map applied to
eight clusters captioned the platelets as "DC" in a published figure. Cluster numbers are not
identities; change a parameter or a package version and cluster 7 can be a different
population. That's why truecell's own tutorial has a test asserting the map's keys equal the
clusters the pipeline produced, and why the annotation cell above asserts the same before it
draws anything. **If you take one operational habit from this notebook: after renaming, look
at the plot and check a marker.**

### Scoring a gene programme

Often the question isn't "which cluster is this" but "how much of *this behaviour* is each
cell doing". `add_module_score` averages a gene set per cell and — importantly — subtracts a
matched control set drawn from genes of similar expression, so a cell doesn't score high just
for being deeply sequenced.

Here's a cytotoxicity signature. It should light up NK and CD8 T cells and nothing else.

The same machinery with a purpose-built gene set: score the S and G2/M programmes, assign a

Resting blood cells shouldn't be proliferating, so this is effectively a negative control.

""")

md(r"""
**Taken at face value, that says over half this blood sample is actively replicating.** For
resting PBMCs that is nonsense — and the second table shows why.

Both scores have a median near zero (about −0.01 and −0.04) and a standard deviation around
0.05. Essentially every cell is sitting at zero, which is the correct answer. But `Phase` is
assigned by taking whichever score is *larger*, and when both are noise centred on zero, that
comparison is close to a coin flip. The label is confident; the underlying signal is absent.

**So check the score distribution before you believe the phase.** A genuinely cycling
population looks nothing like this — you'd see a long right tail and a clearly bimodal spread,
which the `max` column hints at here (a handful of cells do reach 0.6–0.8; those few are real).

This matters most on tumours and cell lines, where proliferation is real and strong enough
that cells cluster by *cell cycle* instead of by cell type. That's what
`scale_data(vars_to_regress=["S.Score", "G2M.Score"])` is for.

### The DE test menu

`find_markers` is one function with a choice of statistics behind it. The default `wilcox` is
rank-based and assumption-light. Others suit other questions — and it's instructive to see
how much the answer depends on the test.
""")

code(r"""
results = {t: find_markers(pbmc, ident_1="NK", ident_2="CD8 T", test_use=t, only_pos=True)

# Rank each test by its own verdict: p-value for the three that produce one,
# AUC for roc, which doesn't.
pd.DataFrame({
    t: list(r.sort_values("myAUC" if t == "roc" else "p_val",
                          ascending=(t != "roc")).index[:6])
    for t, r in results.items()
})
""")

md(r"""
NK versus CD8 T is a genuinely hard call — closely related killers — and yet `GZMB` leads all
four tests, and `PRF1`, `TYROBP` and `GNLY` make every test's top six too. That's the usual
outcome, and it's worth knowing: **the choice of statistic matters far less than people expect.**
`wilcox` is the
default because it's rank-based and makes almost no assumptions, not because it's uniquely
correct.

### What *does* change the answer is the column you sort by

Here's a subtlety with real consequences. `avg_log2FC` is computed from the expression values
themselves — **it doesn't depend on the test at all.** Only the p-value does. So ranking by
fold change makes every test produce an identical list, which looks like agreement but is
really just a fact about that column.

And it's a *different* list:
""")

code(r"""
roc = results["roc"]
pd.DataFrame({
    "by avg_log2FC": list(roc.sort_values("avg_log2FC", ascending=False).index[:6]),
    "by myAUC":      list(roc.sort_values("myAUC", ascending=False).index[:6]),
})
""")

md(r"""
**Same test, same cells, two different answers** — and neither is wrong.

Fold change rewards the biggest *relative* jump, which favours lowly-expressed genes where a
small absolute difference is a large ratio. AUC rewards genes that actually **classify**
(1.0 = perfect separator, 0.5 = useless), which favours abundant, reliable ones — `GZMB`,
`GNLY`, `PRF1`, `NKG7`, the genes you'd put on a flow-cytometry panel.

Want a marker to name a cluster? Take the AUC list. Want to know what's biologically different
between two populations? The fold-change list holds things AUC buries. The lesson generalises
well past this function: **when a tool ranks things for you, find out what it ranked by.**

Also available: `LR` (with covariates via `latent_vars`), `negbinom`, `poisson`, `mast`, and
`deseq2`, which tests every cell as a replicate, as Seurat's does, or sums each sample's cells
first with `sample_col=`.

## 10 · Everything this one dataset can't show

PBMC 3k is a single sample, one modality, no tissue coordinates. Most of truecell's surface
needs data this notebook doesn't have. Here's the map of it — the code is real, and each row
links to a worked tutorial.

### Batch correction and integration

Two experiments run on different days will separate by *day* before they separate by cell
type. Integration removes that while keeping the biology.

```python
from truecell import run_harmony, integrate_layers

run_harmony(obj, group_by_vars="batch")                    # fast, embedding-level
integrate_layers(obj, method="cca")                        # Seurat's anchor-based CCA
integrate_layers(obj, method="rpca")                       # faster, more conservative
```

→ [Integration tutorial](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/integration_vignette/) —
Harmony, CCA and RPCA all reach batch mixing 0.991 on the ifnb IFN-β benchmark, above
Seurat's own 0.917.

### Reference mapping — annotate by borrowing labels

Instead of naming clusters by hand, project your cells onto an annotated reference and
transfer its labels.

```python
from truecell import find_transfer_anchors, transfer_data, map_query

anchors = find_transfer_anchors(reference=ref, query=query, dims=range(30))
labels  = transfer_data(anchors, refdata=ref.meta_data["celltype"])
map_query(anchors, query=query, reference=ref)             # + place it in the reference UMAP
```

→ [Reference mapping tutorial](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/refmap_vignette/) —
98.87% per-cell concordant with R Seurat on the panc8 cross-technology benchmark.

### CITE-seq — RNA and surface protein together

Antibody-derived tags measure protein on the same cells. WNN learns, per cell, how much to
trust each modality — RNA for a cell whose transcriptome is decisive, protein for one whose
surface markers are.

```python
from truecell import find_multi_modal_neighbors

find_multi_modal_neighbors(obj, reduction_list=["pca", "apca"],
                           dims_list=[range(30), range(18)])
```

→ [CITE-seq tutorial](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/multimodal_citeseq/)

### Cell hashing — untangling pooled samples

Pool samples, tag each with a hashtag antibody, sequence together, then demultiplex —
including the doublets, which are visible precisely because they carry two tags.

```python
from truecell import hto_demux, multiseq_demux

hto_demux(obj, assay="HTO")        # Seurat's HTODemux
multiseq_demux(obj, assay="HTO")   # the MULTI-seq alternative
```

→ [Hashing tutorial](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/hashing_vignette/) — 99.81%
call-concordant with R Seurat.

### Pooled CRISPR screens — Mixscape

In a CRISPR screen not every cell carrying a guide is actually perturbed. Mixscape separates
true knockouts from escapers.

```python
from truecell import calc_perturb_sig, run_mixscape, mixscape_lda

calc_perturb_sig(obj, assay="RNA", nt_cell_class="NT")
run_mixscape(obj)                  # -> mixscape_class: "<gene> KO" / NP / NT
mixscape_lda(obj)
```

→ [Mixscape tutorial](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/mixscape_vignette/) — 97.68%
per-cell concordant on the THP-1 ECCITE-seq screen.

### Spatial transcriptomics

Xenium, Visium, CosMx and MERSCOPE, with the cells' physical positions kept — so you can ask
which cell types sit next to which, and which genes vary across the tissue.

```python
from truecell import (load_xenium, load_visium, build_niche_assay,
                      find_spatially_variable_features, image_dim_plot)

obj = load_xenium("path/to/xenium/")
build_niche_assay(obj, fov="fov", group_by="celltype")
find_spatially_variable_features(obj, layer="data", method="moransi")
```

→ [Xenium](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/xenium_spatial_tutorial/) ·
[Visium](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/visium_vignette/) — verified to 8 significant
figures against R Seurat.

### SCTransform — normalization as a model

An alternative to the log-normalize/scale pair: fit a regularized negative binomial per gene
and use its Pearson residuals. Usually better for datasets with wide depth variation.

```python
from truecell import sctransform

sctransform(obj, vst_flavor="v2")
```

→ [SCTransform tutorial](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/sctransform_vignette/)

### Millions of cells

Two strategies, and they compose.

```python
from truecell import sketch_data, project_data, write_lazy_matrix, open_lazy_matrix

sketch_data(obj, ncells=50_000)     # leverage-weighted subset — rare states kept, not lost
project_data(obj)                   # extend the sketch's PCA/UMAP/labels back to every cell

write_lazy_matrix(counts, "store/")             # memory-mapped, BPCells-style
obj.assays["RNA"].layers["counts"] = open_lazy_matrix("store/")
```

→ [Sketching](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/sketch_vignette/) ·
[Out-of-core](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/tutorials/lazy_vignette/)

### And the rest

`run_tsne`, `run_ica`, `run_spca` (supervised PCA off a cell graph), `glm_pca` (Poisson/NB PCA
straight on counts), `jack_straw` (PC significance), `find_conserved_markers` (markers holding
across conditions), `composition_test` (does cell-type proportion shift between groups),
`ridge_plot`, `dim_heatmap`, `image_feature_plot`.

Two differences that will bite if you don't know them:

1. **Indexing is 0-based.** R's `dims = 1:10` is `dims=range(10)`.
2. **Most pipeline functions modify in place and return `None`.** Write
   `run_pca(obj)`, not `obj = run_pca(obj)`. The exceptions are `subset()` and the
   plotting functions, which return something.

### Is it actually the same answer?

Fair question, and the project treats it as the central one. Each tutorial has a matching R
script that runs the same analysis in Seurat, and the two are compared numerically rather
than by eye. Deterministic steps agree to floating-point precision. Louvain carries Seurat's own
random stream, so the same graph gives Seurat's clusters; steps whose RNG differs between the
languages (UMAP, the module-score control sets) agree within measured, declared bands.

Where they disagreed, the cause has more than once turned out to be a defect on the
**truecell** side — found by these comparisons and fixed — and at least once a defect in
Seurat itself.

## Where to go next

You started with an unlabelled matrix and finished with a named map of the human immune
system. The same eight steps — QC, normalize, select, scale, reduce, cluster, mark, name —
are the backbone of nearly every scRNA-seq analysis you'll run.

**Try this next, on this notebook, before you leave it:**

- Re-run from §6 with `resolution=1.0`. How many clusters? Do the extra ones have their own
  markers, or did you just split a real one in half?
- Subset the CD14+ monocytes and re-run the pipeline on them alone. The dendritic cells are
  in there.
- Change `dims=range(10)` to `dims=range(5)`. Which cell type disappears first?

**Then:**

- 📖 [Documentation](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/) — API reference and all
  eighteen tutorials
- 🔬 [Fidelity report](https://genomicai.github.io/truecell/fidelity/) — how the port is
  checked against R Seurat
- 💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/GenomicAI/truecell) — issues and contributions welcome
- 📦 [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/truecell/)

```bash
pip install "truecell[analysis]"
```
