"""Declared bands for the numbers that move, and the handoff check they rest on.

Two numbers in the R-comparison suite are expected to differ from Seurat's, and
both were recorded as prose. `deseq2`'s overlap with Seurat's top 50 genes is a
*divergence measurement* — truecell tests pseudobulk samples where `DESeq2DETest`
tests cells — and JackStraw's PC cutoff moves with the seed, because R's
`JackRandom` seeds each replicate from its loop index and truecell seeds from its
`seed` argument. A sentence in a vignette does not fail, so a genuine regression
that landed anywhere inside the expected spread read as ordinary variation. This
module gives each of those a :class:`Band` with a stated reason, and gives the
numbers that should be *exact* a band as well, so the parity tables in
`de_vignette.md` and `dimreduc_vignette.md` are checked rather than described.

It also carries the precondition without which none of those bands mean
anything. Both `--report` paths align the R side onto the Python side by name —
`reindex` in the dim-reduction tutorial, an index intersection in the DE one —
and neither noticed when the R run predated the handoff it was answering. On
this working copy the DE report was comparing a 25 July Python run against a
19 July R run taken on a *different* cluster assignment, and printed a full
parity table: `pct.1` and `pct.2` are pure counts over the shared cells, and they
disagreed for 12,491 of 13,712 genes. The numbers looked like a `wilcox`
regression rather than a stale file. :class:`StaleReferenceError` is raised now
instead.
