"""The Truecell arm of the performance benchmark.

Run through :mod:`run_benchmarks`, which measures this process from outside::

    python tutorials/benchmark/run_benchmarks.py run --bench pbmc3k_core

Every bench here has a line-for-line counterpart in ``bench_seurat.R``, with
the same parameters in the same order. Where the two stacks genuinely cannot do
the same thing the difference is a *separate step*, never a silent one — R gets
an extra ``neighbours_annoy`` step because Seurat's default neighbour search is
approximate and truecell's is exact, so the honest comparison needs both
numbers rather than a choice between them.

Each step records an anchor: a scalar the report uses to show the two arms
produced the same result before it compares how long they took.
