# parent samples resident set size from outside the child, so anything else
# competing for cores or memory lands in the numbers.
#
# Order is not arbitrary. Within every bench the truecell arm runs first,
# because it writes the cell-to-cluster assignment and the Xenium cell subset
# that the R arm reads back; that is what keeps the two arms doing the same
# work rather than merely the same named step.
