"""The object model itself — Truecell vs R Seurat on pbmc3k.

Every other tutorial in this series compares an *algorithm*: does ``run_pca``
land where ``RunPCA`` lands, does ``hto_demux`` call the same cells. This one
compares the **container** — the accessors, the layer machinery and the
bookkeeping that Seurat's own "command cheat sheet" vignette is made of:

  * ``Cells`` / ``Features`` / ``dim`` — who is in the object, in what order;
  * ``Layers`` / ``LayerData`` / ``split`` / ``JoinLayers`` — the v5 layered
    assay, the single biggest change from Seurat v4;
  * ``DefaultAssay`` / ``GetAssayData`` / ``Key`` / ``VariableFeatures``;
  * ``Embeddings`` / ``Loadings`` / ``Stdev`` on a ``DimReduc``;
  * ``Graphs`` and ``as_graph`` / ``as_neighbor``;
  * ``FetchData``, ``Idents`` / ``WhichCells`` / ``RenameIdents`` / ``subset``;
  * ``Command`` — the log of what has been run on the object;
  * ``Misc`` / ``Tool`` — the user-extensible slots.

Why this is the sharpest net in the series
------------------------------------------
Almost nothing here is stochastic. Cell orders, layer names, matrix dimensions,
key strings, non-zero counts and command names either match R exactly or they
are wrong — 89 of the 91 anchors are compared with no tolerance at all. The
other tutorials have to argue about whether a 2 % gap is RNG or a bug; this one
mostly does not have that conversation. The exceptions are the two anchors that
read a PCA (``pca_stdev_head`` and ``abs_PC_1_sum``), where truecell's randomized
SVD and Seurat's ``irlba`` differ in the fourth decimal; they are named
explicitly in :data:`FLOAT_TOLERANCES` rather than covered by a blanket rule.

That matters because the object layer is where a defect is quietest. A broken
``run_pca`` shows up in a plot. A broken ``JoinLayers`` returns a matrix of
exactly the right shape, full of exactly the right numbers, in the wrong order.

Coverage gap this closes
------------------------
``Assay5``, ``StdAssay``, ``Graph``, ``TruecellCommand`` and ``log_truecell_command``
are public exports that appeared in **no** tutorial before this one, and
``join_layers`` / ``split_layers`` had **zero call sites and zero tests**
anywhere in the package — the defining feature of the v5 object model, and
nothing had ever run it. (The legacy v3 ``Assay`` and ``create_assay_object``
are still uncovered: this tutorial builds ``Assay5`` objects throughout, which
is what ``create_truecell_object`` returns.)

What it found
-------------
**Eleven** fidelity defects across four areas, all fixed in the pull request
that brought this tutorial: five in the layered assay, three in ``FetchData``,
and three in the object's bookkeeping. Most were in code no test touched; the
rest were guarded by tests that could not fail.

**The layered assay — ``split`` / ``JoinLayers`` was not a round trip.** After a
split and a join, truecell returned a layer named ``joined`` (Seurat restores the
original name), holding the right numbers **in the split's order** rather than
the assay's. The assay's own cell vector never moves during a split, so the
matrix came back silently transposed against the metadata that indexes it: ask
for cell ``c1``'s column and get ``c2``'s. Nothing raised, the shape was right,
and the checksums were right, because every value was still present. The
no-argument ``join_layers()`` — R's idiom, and the only call a real script makes
— additionally raised ``ValueError`` on any prepared assay, because it hstacked
``counts``, ``data`` and a variable-features-only ``scale.data`` together
regardless of their differing feature counts. And ``truecell.generics.split_layers``
was declared but never registered for any type, so the documented generic raised
``NotImplementedError`` while the method it should have dispatched to worked.

**``FetchData`` returned objects instead of numbers.** ``np.asarray`` on a sparse
matrix yields a 0-d *object* array wrapping it, not its contents, so
``.flatten()`` broadcast one ``csc_matrix`` down all 2,700 rows: every cell's
"expression" was a copy of the whole matrix. This is the most-called accessor in
Seurat, on the default assay class. It had a test — ``test_fetch_data`` — which
asserted the column name and the row count, both of which that satisfies
perfectly. Two smaller gaps came with it: embedding columns could not be
addressed by their ``Key`` (``PC_1`` raised ``KeyError``; R names them that way
precisely so they can be), and an unqualified fetch read ``counts`` where R reads
``data``, returning raw integers where every vignette shows normalized values.

**The command log was inert.** ``log_truecell_command`` was a public export with no
call sites, so ``obj.commands`` was always empty. Seurat logs five entries for
this pipeline, keyed ``NormalizeData.RNA`` through ``FindNeighbors.RNA.pca``.
Also: ``orig.ident`` — the first column of every Seurat object's metadata — was
never created, and ``add_meta_data`` rejected the plain vector that R's
``AddMetaData`` documents and every vignette passes it.

Two differences were left standing here on purpose and closed later, in PR #55.
``FindNeighbors`` built a *symmetrized* kNN graph where Seurat's is directed
(nnz 75,740 against exactly 2,700 × 20 = 54,000), and the SNN dropped the
self-edge Seurat keeps. Both belonged to ``find_neighbors`` rather than to the
object model, so they got their own comparison; both now match exactly.

The R side pins ``nn.method = "rann"``. Seurat defaults to the approximate
``annoy`` while this port's neighbour search is exact, so the default compared
two different neighbour tables and charged the difference — 182 SNN edges — to
the object model.

Conventions
-----------
The batch column that drives the layer split is assigned **deterministically**
(alternating cells), not with ``sample()`` as Seurat's vignette does, so that R
and Python split on identical membership and any difference downstream belongs
to the layer code rather than to two different random draws.

Identities come from marker-gene thresholds rather than from clustering for the
same reason: Louvain drifts by a cluster between the two tools, which would put
noise into ``WhichCells`` / ``subset`` / ``RenameIdents`` comparisons that are
otherwise exact.
