# Multimodal Tutorial — CITE-seq (RNA + Protein) with R Seurat vs Truecell

A Python port of Seurat's
[multimodal vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/multimodal_vignette)
using the **CBMC CITE-seq** dataset (GSE100866): ~8,600 cord-blood mononuclear
cells profiled simultaneously for the transcriptome and **13 surface proteins**
(antibody-derived tags, "ADT"). It showcases Truecell's **multi-assay** support:
cluster on RNA, attach the protein counts as a second assay, CLR-normalise them,
and read protein levels on the RNA-derived UMAP.

> **Dataset:** 8k CBMCs, CITE-seq — Stoeckius et al. 2017 (GSE100866)
> **Python:** Truecell v0.2.0

> **Scope note.** Truecell stores and normalises multiple assays, visualises one
> against another, **and** performs multimodal *integration* via Weighted
> Nearest Neighbor (WNN) analysis (Step 8) — learning a per-cell RNA-vs-protein
> weight and clustering both modalities jointly.

```bash
python tutorials/cbmc_citeseq_tutorial.py     # printed validation + the numeric handoff
python tutorials/generate_multimodal_plots.py # writes figures_multimodal/  (Truecell figures)
Rscript tutorials/cbmc_citeseq_verify.R       # R figures + r_adt_clr.csv / r_cell_weights.csv
python tutorials/cbmc_citeseq_tutorial.py --report   # the side-by-side, per protein and per cell
```

> **About the figures.** Each step shows a genuine **side-by-side comparison**:
> the **left** image is real **R Seurat** output (`cbmc_citeseq_verify.R`, titled
> *"R Seurat – …"*) and the **right** image is **Truecell**
> (`generate_multimodal_plots.py`). Both run the identical RNA workflow, the same
> CLR transform, and the same protein-gated annotation — with the same
> thresholds — on the same data, and both cluster with Seurat's modularity
> optimiser. The neighbour graphs they build still differ slightly, so compare the
> *structure*, not exact positions or cluster numbers.

## Step 1 · Load RNA + Protein, align barcodes

The RNA matrix mixes human and mouse spike-in genes; both Seurat and Truecell keep
the human genes. RNA and ADT are aligned to their shared cell barcodes.

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
library(Seurat)
cbmc.rna <- as.sparse(read.csv("GSE100866_...RNA_umi.csv.gz", row.names = 1))
cbmc.rna <- CollapseSpeciesExpressionMatrix(cbmc.rna)   # keep human
cbmc.adt <- as.sparse(read.csv("GSE100866_...ADT_umi.csv.gz", row.names = 1))

joint <- intersect(colnames(cbmc.rna), colnames(cbmc.adt))
cbmc.rna <- cbmc.rna[, joint]
cbmc.adt <- cbmc.adt[, joint]
```

</td><td>

```python
from truecell.datasets import cbmc_citeseq
# downloads ~15 MB, keeps human genes, aligns shared barcodes
rna, genes, adt, proteins, cells = cbmc_citeseq()
# rna: (20379 genes x 8617 cells)   adt: (13 proteins x 8617 cells)
# proteins: CD3 CD4 CD8 CD45RA CD56 CD16 CD10 CD11c CD14 CD19 CD34 CCR5 CCR7
```

</td></tr>
</table>

---

## Step 2 · Create the object & run the RNA workflow

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
cbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = cbmc.rna)
cbmc <- NormalizeData(cbmc)
cbmc <- FindVariableFeatures(cbmc)
cbmc <- ScaleData(cbmc)
cbmc <- RunPCA(cbmc, npcs = 30)
cbmc <- FindNeighbors(cbmc, dims = 1:15)
cbmc <- FindClusters(cbmc, resolution = 0.6)
cbmc <- RunUMAP(cbmc, dims = 1:15)
```

</td><td>

```python
from truecell.truecell import create_truecell_object
from truecell.preprocessing import normalize_data, find_variable_features, scale_data
from truecell.reduction import run_pca
from truecell.neighbors import find_neighbors
from truecell.clustering import find_clusters
from truecell.umap import run_umap

obj = create_truecell_object(counts=rna, assay="RNA", min_cells=3,
                           feature_names=genes, cell_names=cells, project="cbmc")
normalize_data(obj)
find_variable_features(obj, selection_method="vst", nfeatures=2000)
scale_data(obj, features=obj.assays["RNA"]._all_feature_names)
run_pca(obj, n_pcs=30, features=obj.assays["RNA"].variable_features)
find_neighbors(obj, dims=range(15), k_param=20)
find_clusters(obj, resolution=0.6, random_seed=0)
run_umap(obj, dims=range(15), seed=42)
```

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_01_rna_umap_clusters.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/01_rna_umap_clusters.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Step 3 · Add the protein (ADT) assay & CLR-normalise

The antibody counts become a **second assay**. Proteins are normalised with the
centered-log-ratio transform, applied per cell across the 13-protein panel
(`margin = 2`) — the recommended setting for small ADT panels.

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
adt_assay <- CreateAssayObject(counts = cbmc.adt)
cbmc[["ADT"]] <- adt_assay

cbmc <- NormalizeData(cbmc, assay = "ADT",
                      normalization.method = "CLR", margin = 2)
```

</td><td>

```python
from truecell.assay5 import create_assay5_object

obj.assays["ADT"] = create_assay5_object(
    counts=adt_aligned, feature_names=proteins,
    cell_names=obj.cell_names(), key="adt_",
)
normalize_data(obj, assay="ADT", normalization_method="CLR", margin=2)
# obj.assay_names() -> ['RNA', 'ADT']
```

</td></tr>
</table>

> `margin` means exactly what it means in Seurat, axis included: Seurat's
> `CustomNormalize` runs `apply(data, MARGIN = margin, clr_function)`, and R's
> `apply` treats `MARGIN = 1` as rows and `MARGIN = 2` as columns. So with counts
> stored features × cells, **`margin = 1` normalises each protein across cells**
> (Seurat's default) and **`margin = 2` normalises each cell across its
> proteins** (what ADT panels want). Truecell had these two swapped until the fix
> described at the end of Step 8.

---

## Step 4 · Visualise protein on the RNA UMAP

In R you switch `DefaultAssay()` (or use the `adt_`/`rna_` key prefixes); in
Truecell you pass `assay="ADT"`.

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
DefaultAssay(cbmc) <- "ADT"
FeaturePlot(cbmc, c("CD3","CD4","CD8","CD19",
                    "CD14","CD16","CD56","CD11c"))
```

</td><td>

```python
from truecell.plotting import feature_plot

feature_plot(obj, ["CD3","CD4","CD8","CD19",
                   "CD14","CD16","CD56","CD11c"],
             assay="ADT", reduction="umap",
             min_cutoff="q05", max_cutoff="q95", ncol=4)
```

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_03_adt_featureplots.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/03_adt_featureplots.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

The surface proteins cleanly mark their lineages: CD3/CD4 the T-cell mass,
CD19 the B-cell island, CD8/CD16/CD56 the NK cluster, CD14/CD11c the monocytes.

---

## Step 5 · Protein vs RNA for the same marker

The CITE-seq payoff: protein gives a smooth, high signal-to-noise readout where
the encoding mRNA is sparse and noisy.

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
# adt_ / rna_ key prefixes pull from each assay
FeaturePlot(cbmc, c("adt_CD19", "rna_CD19",
                    "adt_CD3",  "rna_CD3E"), ncol = 2)
```

</td><td>

```python
# left column assay="ADT", right column assay="RNA"
feature_plot(obj, ["CD19"], assay="ADT", reduction="umap")
feature_plot(obj, ["CD19"], assay="RNA", reduction="umap")
# (generate_multimodal_plots.py draws them paired)
```

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_04_protein_vs_rna.png" width="380"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/04_protein_vs_rna.png" width="380"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Step 6 · Ridge plots & protein bivariates

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
RidgePlot(cbmc, features = c("adt_CD3","adt_CD19",
                             "adt_CD14","adt_CD56"), ncol = 2)

FeatureScatter(cbmc, "adt_CD19", "adt_CD3")
FeatureScatter(cbmc, "adt_CD4",  "adt_CD8")
```

</td><td>

```python
from truecell.plotting import ridge_plot, feature_scatter

ridge_plot(obj, ["CD3","CD19","CD14","CD56"], assay="ADT",
           group_by="protein_celltype", ncol=2)

feature_scatter(obj, "CD19", "CD3", assay="ADT")
feature_scatter(obj, "CD4",  "CD8", assay="ADT")
```

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_05_adt_ridgeplots.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/05_adt_ridgeplots.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_06_adt_scatter_CD4_CD8.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/06_adt_scatter_CD4_CD8.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_07_adt_scatter_CD19_CD3.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/07_adt_scatter_CD19_CD3.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

The CD4-vs-CD8 and CD19-vs-CD3 protein scatters separate the major lineages on
just two axes.

---

## Step 7 · Annotate cell types (protein + RNA)

CITE-seq proteins are cleaner lineage markers than RNA, so `annotate_cells()`
gates on the ADT assay (T→NK→B→monocyte→DC→progenitor) and falls back to RNA
markers for populations the 13-protein panel can't resolve — platelets (`PPBP`),
erythroid (`HBB`), pDC (`IGJ`/`PLD4`), and cycling cells.

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
# manual, by inspecting protein + RNA markers
cbmc <- RenameIdents(cbmc, ...)
DimPlot(cbmc, label = TRUE)
```

</td><td>

```python
from tutorials.cbmc_citeseq_tutorial import annotate_cells
from truecell.plotting import dim_plot

anno = annotate_cells(obj)
obj.stash_ident("rna_clusters")
obj.rename_idents(anno)
dim_plot(obj, reduction="umap", group_by="protein_celltype", label=True)
```

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_02_rna_umap_celltypes.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/02_rna_umap_celltypes.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Step 8 · Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) multimodal clustering

Steps 2–7 cluster on **RNA alone** and read protein on top. WNN (Hao et al.,
*Cell* 2021) goes further: it learns, **per cell**, how much to trust each
modality and clusters on a *joint* graph. A cell whose lineage is crisp in
protein space is weighted toward ADT; a cell the antibody panel can say nothing
useful about is weighted toward RNA.

Crucially the weights are **decisive, not hedged**: they use the full 0–1 range,
and most cells commit to one modality rather than sitting at 0.5. That is by
design — the modality score is clipped at 200 before the softmax, so a cell with
a clear preference saturates.

Which cells end up on which side is an empirical result, not something you can
read off the panel design. Mostly the table below tracks the panel, but not
everywhere: **CD8 T leans on RNA (0.37) even though CD8 is one of the 13
antibodies**, while CD4 T leans the other way at 0.64. Seurat says the same
(0.38 / 0.64), so it is a property of the data and the method rather than of
this port — but this tutorial does not explain it.

The protein modality first gets its own reduction (`"apca"`); then
`find_multi_modal_neighbors` builds the joint `wknn`/`wsnn` graphs and writes
a per-cell weight for each modality. Clustering and UMAP then run **on the joint
graph** instead of the RNA PCA.

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```r
DefaultAssay(cbmc) <- "ADT"
VariableFeatures(cbmc) <- rownames(cbmc[["ADT"]])
cbmc <- ScaleData(cbmc)
# 13 proteins, so npcs must stay well under that; irlba needs
# the gap, hence approx = FALSE
cbmc <- RunPCA(cbmc, reduction.name = "apca", reduction.key = "apca_",
               npcs = 12, approx = FALSE)

cbmc <- FindMultiModalNeighbors(
  cbmc, reduction.list = list("pca", "apca"),
  dims.list = list(1:15, 1:12), k.nn = 20
)
cbmc <- FindClusters(cbmc, graph.name = "wsnn", resolution = 0.6)
cbmc <- RunUMAP(cbmc, nn.name = "weighted.nn",
                reduction.name = "wnn.umap")

# per-cell modality weights land in metadata:
#   cbmc$RNA.weight , cbmc$ADT.weight
```

</td><td>

```python
from truecell.reduction import run_pca
from truecell.preprocessing import scale_data
from truecell.multimodal import find_multi_modal_neighbors

# protein modality needs its own reduction
adt_features = obj.assays["ADT"]._all_feature_names
scale_data(obj, assay="ADT", features=adt_features)
run_pca(obj, assay="ADT", reduction_name="apca",
        reduction_key="apca_", n_pcs=12, features=adt_features)

find_multi_modal_neighbors(
    obj, reduction_list=["pca", "apca"],
    dims_list=[range(15), range(12)], k_nn=20,
)
find_clusters(obj, graph_name="wsnn", resolution=0.6, random_seed=0)
run_umap(obj, graph="wsnn", reduction_name="wnn_umap", seed=42)

# per-cell modality weights land in meta_data:
#   obj.meta_data["RNA.weight"] , obj.meta_data["ADT.weight"]
```

</td></tr>
</table>

Because the ADT panel has only 13 proteins, `apca` keeps every informative
component (`n_pcs ≤ 12`). Inspect the learned weights by grouping `ADT.weight`
by the Step-7 labels:

```python
obj.meta_data.groupby("protein_celltype")["ADT.weight"].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

The lineages the antibody panel targets head-on lean on protein, and the
ordering tracks how well the panel covers each type. Seurat's numbers on the
same data are alongside:

| Cell type | Truecell `ADT.weight` | R Seurat | in the panel? |
|-----------|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| NK | 0.65 | 0.65 | CD16 + CD56 |
| CD4 T | 0.64 | 0.64 | CD4 — and CD4/CD8 is a protein call, not an RNA one |
| B | 0.54 | 0.54 | CD19 |
| CD14+ Mono | 0.48 | 0.49 | CD14 |
| Erythroid | 0.40 | 0.40 | ✗ |
| CD8 T | 0.37 | 0.38 | CD8 |
| Platelet | 0.29 | 0.30 | ✗ |
| Progenitor | 0.28 | 0.29 | CD34 only |
| DC / Mono | — | 0.21 | ✗ — no clean DC probe |

The panel's targets sit at the top and the populations it cannot see sit at the
bottom, which is the result you would hope for. `DC / Mono` is the case worth
dwelling on: protein tells WNN almost nothing about those cells, so nearly all
the weight goes to RNA. A weighting pinned near 0.5 could never express that.
truecell's RNA clusters fold those 69 cells into CD14+ Mono, so the label gets no
row of its own here, but truecell weights the same cells 0.21 as well. Erythroid
and platelet carry no antibody either, and both duly fall back toward RNA.

**Progenitor is the one row that does not line up** — 0.35 here against R's 0.29,
where every other type agrees to 0.02. It is a 146-cell population, and the two
sides do not cut quite the same cells into it (R's progenitor cluster carries
mean CD34 1.31, Truecell's 1.5).

This used to be as far as the tutorial could go: it read like small-population
clustering noise rather than a difference in the WNN maths, but that was a
reading. **It is now established.** Re-grouping Truecell's *own* per-cell weights
by *R's* labels puts progenitor at **0.283** against R's 0.285 — the weights
agree to three decimals, and the gap was entirely in which cells carry the
label. See [How close is this to Seurat?](#how-close-is-this-to-seurat) for the
per-cell comparison that shows it.

### Reading the plots

`08_wnn_umap_clusters.png` is the joint embedding. The comparison that matters
is `09_wnn_vs_rna_umap.png` — the *same cells with the same labels*, embedded on
RNA alone (left) and on the joint graph (right):

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_09_wnn_vs_rna_umap.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/09_wnn_vs_rna_umap.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

UMAP has no canonical rotation, so don't read the orientation — read which
populations form their own islands. Both sides resolve CD4 T, CD14+ Mono, NK and
B as separate territories, with erythroid/platelet/progenitor grouped away from
the immune lineages.

`10_adt_weight_by_celltype.png` plots the weights themselves. The violins are
**bimodal against the 0 and 1 rails** rather than a bump at 0.5 — individual
cells commit, and the per-type mean is a summary of that split, not a
description of a typical cell:

<table>
<tr><th>R (Seurat)</th><th>Python (Truecell)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/r_10_adt_weight_by_celltype.png" width="420"/></td>
<td><img src="figures_multimodal/10_adt_weight_by_celltype.png" width="420"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

> `ADT.weight` is a metadata column, not a gene, but `vln_plot` resolves it the
> same way Seurat's `VlnPlot` does — hence the generic `Expression` y-axis label.

> The whole flow is wrapped as `run_wnn(obj)` in
> [`cbmc_citeseq_tutorial.py`](cbmc_citeseq_tutorial.py); `run_full()` prints the
> WNN cluster count and the mean modality weights per cell type.

### How close is this to Seurat?

Close, and now measured rather than asserted. `--report` compares three things
against a live Seurat 5.5.1 run:

| Quantity | Agreement |
|---|---|
| **ADT CLR** — per-protein mean · sd · min · max | max abs diff **4.2e-15** (no RNG anywhere in it) |
| **WNN modality weight**, per cell on 8,617 shared barcodes | Pearson **0.9847** · Spearman 0.9816 · median abs diff **0.0152** |
| Mean ADT weight, whole panel | 0.5539 against 0.5556 — relative 3.0e-03 |
| Cell-type label, per cell | **99.07%** concordant (8,537 / 8,617) |
| WNN clusters · cells · genes · proteins | 21 · 8,617 · 20,379 · 13 — all identical |
| RNA clusters | 15 against Seurat's 16: truecell's graph folds Seurat's 69-cell DC/Mono cluster into CD14+ Mono |

**The progenitor gap was never a WNN difference.** This section used to record
progenitor at 0.06 away from Seurat while every other type agreed to 0.02, and
attributed it to cluster boundaries. The per-cell dump settled it: re-grouping
*truecell's own weights* by *R's* labels read **0.283** against R's 0.285. The
weights agreed; the two tools put different cells in the bucket.

| cell type | truecell | R | truecell's weights, R's labels | n (py / R) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Progenitor | 0.352 | 0.285 | **0.283** | 146 / 184 |
| Erythroid | 0.378 | 0.397 | **0.400** | 606 / 566 |
| every other type | — | — | moved by ≤0.003 | — |

Those two rows were the same disagreement seen from both ends: 61 cells on the
progenitor/erythroid boundary landed differently, which barely moved
erythroid's 600-cell mean and visibly moved progenitor's 150-cell one. That is
a small-population effect on an annotation threshold, not a modality-weighting
difference — and it is the kind of thing a per-cell-type summary table can never
distinguish, which is why the handoff is keyed by barcode. With Seurat's
optimiser on both sides that boundary now lands alike: 184 progenitor cells each
and 568 and 566 erythroid, and truecell's own progenitor label reads 0.283.

The residual cause is the graph each tool builds. Seurat's exact (`rann`)
neighbours give the same 16 RNA clusters as its default annoy search, so the
difference sits upstream of the neighbour search, in the embedding. Both sides
run the same CLR and the same `annotate_cells` thresholds, shared verbatim
between the two scripts.

> **This table used to look much worse, and the cause was not in the WNN code.**
> Truecell's CLR had its `margin` flag inverted relative to Seurat: `margin=2`
> computed what Seurat's `margin=1` computes and vice versa, so the protein
> matrix feeding `apca` — and therefore every weight — was the wrong transform.
> The published numbers ran 0.10–0.74 against R's 0.21–0.65, and erythroid and
> platelet sat at 0.62/0.53 against R's 0.40/0.30, on the *protein* side despite
> having no antibody in the panel. That inversion is fixed; the annotation
> thresholds in [`cbmc_citeseq_tutorial.py`](cbmc_citeseq_tutorial.py) and
> [`cbmc_citeseq_verify.R`](cbmc_citeseq_verify.R) had been retuned around it and
> are now shared verbatim. The bug survived because its unit test verified the
> CLR kernel but derived the axis mapping in Python rather than checking it
> against R — right formula, assumed axis. The guard that replaces it
> (`test_clr_margin_matches_r_ground_truth`) pins both margins to fixed output
> from a real Seurat run.
