"""Leverage-score sketching — Truecell vs R Seurat on ifnb.

The Seurat v5 answer to "this atlas has two million cells and I have a laptop":
don't subsample uniformly, subsample by **statistical leverage**, analyse the
small subset, then push the answers back onto every cell.

  * :func:`truecell.leverage_score` ↔ ``LeverageScore`` — per-cell influence on the
    column space of the data. High for a cell in a sparse, distinctive corner;
    low for one of ten thousand near-identical cells in a common state.
  * :func:`truecell.sketch_data` ↔ ``SketchData`` — draws the leverage-weighted
    subset (or a uniform one, as the control).
  * :func:`truecell.project_data` ↔ ``ProjectData`` — the inverse map: every
    full-dataset cell through the sketch's PCA, its fitted UMAP, and its labels.

Why this tutorial exists — and what it found
--------------------------------------------
All three landed with synthetic fixtures only and had never met a Seurat
reference. Building this comparison turned up **two real defects**, both fixed in
the same pull request as this tutorial.

**Defect 2, in one paragraph, because it is the more instructive one.**
``project_data`` transferred the sketch's labels through the
:mod:`truecell.transfer` integration anchors. Seurat's ``ProjectData`` does not:
it calls ``TransferSketchLabels``, a weighted k-nearest-neighbour vote *inside
the projected reduction*, with the sketch's own rows as the reference. The
anchor route scored **better** on ifnb — 0.936 against Seurat's 0.905 — which is
exactly why it survived review. It is still wrong, and not only on fidelity:
finding anchors between the sketch and the full dataset costs precisely what
sketching exists to remove, so on the million-cell objects this API is written
for the anchor route is unusable rather than merely different.

Matching Seurat moved accuracy **down**, to Seurat's. Measured two ways, because
they answer different questions:

* handed **R's own sketch cells**, so the transfer is the only variable, the two
  agree on **98.1 %** of cells (accuracy 0.9031 against R's 0.9050);
* end to end, each tool drawing its own sketch, both land on **exactly 0.9050**
  at 94.9 % per-cell agreement — the extra disagreement is the differing draw,
  not the transfer.

A regression here would look like an improvement, so the test that guards it
checks the mechanism rather than the score.

Defect 1 is ``leverage_score`` itself.

Seurat computes leverage from a **rank-50 truncated SVD** — ``ℓ = rowSums(V²)``
over the leading 50 right singular vectors — so the scores sum to 50. Truecell
whitened against the **full rank** instead. Both are defensible as "leverage" in
the textbook sense, and that is exactly what made it hard to see: the full-rank
version is the classical hat-matrix definition, and truecell's own test asserted it
to six decimals.

But full-rank leverage is useless on data shaped like this. Scores sum to the
rank and are capped at 1, so with 2000 variable features over a few thousand
cells every score is crushed towards ``d/n``:

===========================  ==========  ==========
PBMC 3k, 2000 HVGs           truecell      R Seurat
===========================  ==========  ==========
sum of scores                2000.0      50.0
coefficient of variation     0.085       0.384
max / median                 1.34        6.48
Spearman vs R                0.238       --
===========================  ==========  ==========

A max/median of 1.34 means the single most influential cell in the dataset was
only 34 % more likely to be drawn than a median one — against 6.48× in Seurat,
and 1.00 for uniform sampling. **Sketching was therefore doing almost nothing**:
``sketch_data`` was an expensive way to sample uniformly, which is precisely the
thing leverage sampling exists to avoid. Nothing about the output looked wrong.

After the fix the exact regime agrees with Seurat to **2.4e-6** — below R's own
run-to-run noise, since ``irlba`` starts from a random vector and R never seeds
it.

Why ifnb, and why two regimes
-----------------------------
Seurat picks between two algorithms on cell count, and the tutorial exercises
both on the same data by moving the threshold rather than the dataset:

  * ``nsketch = 10000`` → **exact**: 13,999 cells < 1.5 × 10000, so R takes the
    truncated SVD. Deterministic up to ``irlba``, and truecell matches it exactly.
  * ``nsketch = 5000``  → **sketched**: ``CountSketch`` → ``QR`` →
    Johnson–Lindenstrauss. Both tools draw their random matrices from their own
    RNG, so this one is compared statistically, never bit-for-bit.

ifnb also supplies the thing the method is *for*: 13 annotated cell types
spanning 4,362 cells (CD14 Mono) down to 55 (Eryth). That makes the headline
metric an honest one — not "do the numbers match" but **does the method keep the
rare cells**, measured against held-out annotations both tools can see.

The residuals, and why each is RNG rather than a gap
----------------------------------------------------
Three differences survive, and all three were checked distribution-against-
distribution over matched seeds rather than argued from a single pair of runs:

* **The sketched regime** differs from R at Spearman 0.946. Over seeds
  123/1/7/42/2024 truecell's score sums span 69,611-70,968 and R's 70,278-70,867;
  the CVs span 0.5600-0.5770 and 0.5657-0.5776. The distributions overlap, so
  the difference is the two RNGs, not the algorithm.
* **Sketch composition.** Over the same seeds the rarest types land at
  Eryth 1.44x (1.15-1.91) / pDC 2.26x / Mk 1.58x in truecell against
  1.29x (0.64-2.04) / 2.23x / 1.47x in R — overlapping, and R's Eryth spread is
  the wider of the two. A single-seed comparison made this look like a real
  divergence (0.89x against 1.65x); it was two draws from overlapping
  distributions landing at opposite ends. With ~11 erythrocytes in a 2,000-cell
  sketch, that spread is Poisson noise on a small count.
* **The two regimes against each other.** Seurat's sketched approximation tracks
  its own exact scores at Spearman only 0.31 — the JL projection is a large
  approximation, and Seurat leaves it unscaled, so the sketched scores are not
  even on the same scale (they sum to ~70,000, not 50). truecell reproduces that
  gap at 0.31 too (R 0.309, truecell 0.307), which is the useful evidence that the
  sketched path is faithful. **Compare scores within one regime, never across
  the two**, and read the sketched one as "cheap and roughly right".

Lazy matrices have no R side here
---------------------------------
``LazyMatrix`` / ``open_lazy_matrix`` are truecell's on-disk backing, R's
equivalent being BPCells, which is not installed. So that section is **not** a
side-by-side: it checks the one property that matters, that going through disk
does not change the answer, and is reported separately so it is not mistaken for
an R comparison.

Note on the shared basis
------------------------
Leverage is a property of a *matrix*, so the two tools must score the same one.
The Python run writes the exact cell barcodes and HVG list it used to
``figures_sketch/cells.txt`` and ``hvg_features.txt``; the R script subsets to
those cells and passes that feature list to ``LeverageScore`` explicitly.

**That last word is load-bearing.** ``VariableFeatures(obj) <- hvg`` does *not*
register for ``layer = "data"``, so ``LeverageScore`` silently finds no variable
features, falls back, and scores **all 13,714 genes** — a different matrix, and
no error. Pass ``features =`` explicitly. This cost an hour of chasing a
divergence that was never there.

Usage
-----
