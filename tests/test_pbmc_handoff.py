Tutorials 1 and 2 were the last two in the suite compared entirely by eye:
every figure in `pbmc3k_tutorial.md` links the canonical satijalab.org image,
so nothing failed if the numbers behind them drifted. These cover the pieces of
that handoff that can be exercised without R or a dataset download — the
