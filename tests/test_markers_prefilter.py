"""Guards for `find_markers`' pre-filter-then-densify path.

`find_markers` used to build a dense (all genes × cells) array per group before
it had decided which genes it was going to test. It now runs both pre-filters —
`min_pct` and `logfc_threshold` — on the sparse matrices and densifies only the
genes that survive, which on PBMC 3k is ~1.6k rows of 13.7k.

That split introduced two things worth pinning, neither of which the suite could
see when the change was made:

**A row remap.** The per-gene loops index the dense array by position in
`test_indices`, not by feature index. Getting that wrong attaches every
statistic to the wrong gene — a silent, plausible-looking table. Mutating the
loop index to a constant left the whole suite green for `roc`.

**A dense fallback.** Both `_row_pct_positive` and `_row_expm1_sum` branch on
sparsity, and nothing anywhere ran `find_markers` against a dense layer. Every
mutation of those dense branches survived the full suite.
