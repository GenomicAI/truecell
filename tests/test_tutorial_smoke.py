"""End-to-end tutorial runs.

**These do not run in CI, and are not meant to be mistaken for coverage.** They
need the cached datasets (~200 MB under ``~/.truecell_data``) and take minutes, so
they are gated behind an explicit opt-in:

    TRUECELL_TUTORIAL_SMOKE=1 pytest tests/test_tutorial_smoke.py -v

The gate is an env var rather than a bare "skip if the data is missing" check on
purpose. A test that silently skips wherever the data happens to be absent reads
as green in CI while proving nothing — which is the failure mode that let
``pbmc3k_tutorial.py`` ship broken in the first place. Requiring the opt-in means
a skip here always means "nobody asked for this", never "this passed".

What they cover that ``test_tutorial_marker_tables.py`` cannot: the actual script
path, top to bottom, against real data. The pandas 3 regression lived in the
middle of ``run_tutorial()`` — importable helpers and unit fixtures would not
have reached it. Worth running before cutting a release.
