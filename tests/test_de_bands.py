`de_vignette.md` carries a parity table — top-50 overlap, p-value Spearman,
max |Δlog2FC| — that nothing checked. `deseq2`'s row had drifted from 25/50 to
22/50 unnoticed, and the same silence covered every other row. These tests drive
`measure_bands` and `BANDS` on hand-built tables, so each assertion can be shown
