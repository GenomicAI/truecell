# Signature scoring

Score a gene programme per cell against a background of expression-matched
control genes. `cell_cycle_scoring` is `add_module_score` run twice, on the S and
G2/M lists, plus the discrete phase call.

The control genes are drawn at random from expression bins, so these scores carry
an RNG. Against R Seurat the per-cell phase call is 95.9 % concordant, as close
as two NumPy seeds come to each other, and the continuous scores correlate at
Pearson ≥ 0.997 — the residual is the control draw, and nothing else. [Cell-cycle vignette](../tutorials/cellcycle_vignette.md).
