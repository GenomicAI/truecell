# Differential expression

`find_markers` implements all nine of Seurat's tests: `wilcox` (tie-corrected),
`t`, `bimod`, `LR`, `negbinom`, `poisson`, `roc`, `mast` and `deseq2`. Eight of
them are per-cell and reproduce Seurat's top 50 genes exactly on PBMC 3k;
`deseq2` is pseudobulk and deliberately does not, because it is answering a
different question — see [the DE vignette](../tutorials/de_vignette.md).

Two numbers to know before reading a result table:

- **`avg_log2FC` carries Seurat's pseudocount on the group *sum*, not the group
  mean.** Getting that backwards shifts every fold change and also changes which
  genes clear `logfc_threshold`, so it silently changes the returned gene set,
  not just a column.
- **`pct.1` and `pct.2` are rounded to three decimals**, by Seurat, inside
  `FindMarkers`. Anything comparing two runs gene-by-gene should not expect them
  closer than 5e-4.

## Group summaries

`AggregateExpression` **sums raw counts** and is what pseudobulk differential
expression wants. `AverageExpression` **means the back-transformed values** and
is what a per-group expression summary wants. They are different functions, not
two scalings of one — see each docstring.
