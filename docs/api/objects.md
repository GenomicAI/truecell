# Objects

The container, before any analysis touches it. `Truecell` holds one or more assays,
the reductions computed off them, the neighbour graphs, the per-cell metadata and
the command log — the same slots R's `Seurat` S4 class holds, as ordinary Python
classes with `__slots__`.

The one structural difference worth knowing up front: R's `Assay5` inherits from
`dgCMatrix`; here `Assay5` *wraps* a SciPy CSC matrix rather than subclassing it,
because subclassing `scipy.sparse` is a well-known trap. Everything you reach
through [the generics](generics.md) behaves the same either way.

The object model is checked against Seurat anchor by anchor in
[The Object Model Itself](../tutorials/objects_vignette.md) — 91 of 91 exact, no
tolerance.

## The top-level object

::: truecell.truecell.Truecell

::: truecell.truecell.create_truecell_object

`diet_truecell` strips an object down before saving or sharing it. Note that
`dimreducs` and `graphs` are *keep-lists*: calling it with no arguments removes
every reduction and graph, which is Seurat's behaviour too.
