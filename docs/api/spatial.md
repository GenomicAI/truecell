# Spatial

Imaging-based and spot-based assays: Xenium, Visium, CosMx and MERSCOPE. The
container mirrors Seurat v5's — an `FOV` holding `Centroids`, `Segmentation`
and `Molecules` boundaries, or a `VisiumV2` holding the H&E image and its
`ScaleFactors`.

!!! warning "`radius` on a Visium FOV"
    Seurat stores `spot_diameter_fullres` in the FOV's `radius` slot — a
    diameter where a radius is named — and `Radius()` on its own `VisiumV2`
    returns `NULL`. `load_visium` stores a radius. The slide's fixed 100 µm spot
    pitch is what settles which reading is right; the working is in
    [the Visium vignette](../tutorials/visium_vignette.md).

`find_spatially_variable_features` computes Moran's I on R's inverse-square
distance weights, not on a kNN graph. Those give different answers, and the kNN
version was the bug. Like `FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures` on an object, it reads
`scale.data` unless given `layer="data"`.
